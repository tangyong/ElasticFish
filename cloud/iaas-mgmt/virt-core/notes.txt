Notes on running virtualization with Xen.

Step 0 : 

add glassfish.zip (glassfish installation that will be installed in each vm) in docroot.
add id_dsa.pub to docroot (your ssh public key).

Step 1 : create the master image.

1. install master image with jeos .iso file
2. sudo apt-get install wget

Step 2 : install glassfish and related scripts

3. wget http://<das-ip>:<das-port>/xen/ubuntu/configure-master.sh	
4. sh configure-master.sh <das-ip> <das-http-port> // DO NOT RUN AS ROOT.
5. add the DAS IP and name in the master /etc/hosts (not necessary if the DAS has a static IP).

At this point, you have a glassfish master image that can be used for any
GlassFish DAS. I don't support anything else than domain1 so far. 


Step 3 : 
5. Verify <GlassFishInstall>/domains/domain1/config/xen/virtualizations.xml image location that it is the one you specified in step 1.

6. Run the DAS : 
7. asadmin create-vm-cluser --type=xen cluster1
8. asadmin create-vm-instance

For KVM/QEMU, in order to setup the network bridged which does not exist by default, this is what I have done.

sudo apt-get install bridge-utils
1/ get tuntap packages
my /etc/network/interfaces is like: (see the br0 which has my static ip and eth0 just depends on it)
---
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

#auto br0


auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
        address 10.132.180.171
        netmask 255.255.254.0
        network 10.132.180.0
        broadcast 10.132.181.255
        gateway 10.132.180.1
        # dns-* options are implemented by the resolvconf package, if installed
        dns-name-servers 130.35.249.52 130.35.249.41 138.2.202.15 129.145.155.220
        dns-search us.oracle.com oraclecorp.com oracle.com sfbay.sun.com sun.com

auto br0
iface br0 inet static
        address 10.132.180.47
        netmask 255.255.254.0
        network 10.132.180.0
        broadcast 10.132.181.255
        gateway 10.132.180.1
        # dns-* options are implemented by the resolvconf package, if installed
        dns-name-servers 130.35.249.52 130.35.249.41 138.2.202.15 129.145.155.220
        dns-search us.oracle.com oraclecorp.com oracle.com sfbay.sun.com sun.com
        bridge_ports eth0
        bridge_fd 9
        bridge_hello 2
        bridge_maxage 12
        bridge_stp off

Maybe some extra route commands need to be done to correctly configure the default route.

Also for user usages of the bridge, you need to use the tunctl command
tunctl -u <USERNAME>   (in my case Ludo)

KVM alternative configuration (from Jerome's Dell Laptop)

1. install bridge-utils, kpartx
2. disable automatic eth0 startup in network manager.
3. you may have to manually disable the wireless adapter to avoid conflicts.
4. set you /etc/network/interfaces to DHCP 

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet manual

auto br0
iface br0 inet dhcp
        bridge_ports eth0
        bridge_stp off
        bridge_fd 0
        bridge_maxwait 0

up route add default br0

to manually add a gateway : sudo route add default gw 10.0.1.1 dev br0
ethX is cached in ubuntu in the following file : /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules (delete it to force the re-allocations of ethX at the next reboot).

4. restart networking : sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart.
5. install virt-manager on top of normal KVM installation
6. go to step 0
